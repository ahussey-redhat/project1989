## Description

A fun way to connect Kubernetes chaos testing (Kubeinvaders) with Ansible EDA and Lightspeed.

On the left of the screen you get to play a game of Kubeinvaders.  The game has been modified so that instead of containers, you're shooting pieces of infrastructure.

On the right side, you see how EDA and Lightspeed are attempting to rediate the issue with the infrastructure and create an automated resolution.


## Installation

Everything required to install this project into an OpenShift cluster is run in the "deployall.sh" shell script.
